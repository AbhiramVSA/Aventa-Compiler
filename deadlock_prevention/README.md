# Deadlock Prevention: Banker's Algorithm

This project demonstrates the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock avoidance in operating systems. It provides an interactive CLI to configure processes and resources, perform resource requests, and observe safety checks in real time.

## Features

- Configure processes and resources.
- Load example matrices (Max, Allocation, Available).
- Perform resource requests interactively.
- Step-by-step safety checks.
- Determine if the system is in a SAFE or UNSAFE state.

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed.
2. Clone or copy this project.

## Running the Project

Navigate to the `deadlock_prevention` directory and run:

```bash
python -m deadlock_prevention.bankers.cli
```

## Example Interaction

1. Choose an example system.
2. Run a safety check.
3. Make a resource request.
4. Observe the results and explanations.
